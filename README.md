# quiz-server

Just a light server designed to generate a javascript quiz for an http request. The idea was that these
could be embedded in notion, where the inline webclipper will only accept a url.

To run it, clone the repository and navigate to the root directory. Run the command `flask run` and navigate to localhost:5000 in the browser. You wcan use the credentials:

username: leo
password: foo
