# notion-quiz-server
Notion quiz thing with python server

Takes a GET request with data about questions and answers and returns a javascript quiz applet. *Hopefully* 
this will work with the notion embed feature.

To start the server enter "python notion-quiz-server" in the terminal. It should give you a link to the site.
